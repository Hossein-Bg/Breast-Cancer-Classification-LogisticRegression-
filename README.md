## Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on using Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on various features. The dataset used for this classification is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is commonly used in machine learning for breast cancer classification.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features are computed for each cell nucleus present in the image. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

Dataset source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Google Colab (optional but recommended)
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the performance of the Logistic Regression model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations are included to help interpret the results.
